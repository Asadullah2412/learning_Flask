# Flask Basics – Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository is a **learning journal for Flask basics**. The goal is to understand how Flask works by building small, focused examples instead of jumping into large projects. This repo tracks my progress as I learn how to create APIs, handle requests, and eventually serve machine learning models using Flask.

---

## Why this repository?

I created this repository to:

* Learn Flask fundamentals step by step
* Build consistency through small daily commits
* Understand how backend APIs work in practice
* Connect Flask with machine learning projects in the future

This is not a production-ready project. It is intentionally simple and focused on learning.

---

## What I am learning

* Creating a Flask application
* Defining routes (`GET` and `POST`)
* Handling JSON requests and responses
* Basic API structure
* Preparing Flask apps for ML model integration

---

## Current Progress

* ✅ Basic Flask app setup
* ✅ First routes and responses
* ⏳ API testing and request handling
* ⏳ ML model serving (`/predict` endpoint)

---

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Flask
* Git & GitHub

---

## Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **learning-by-doing** approach. Code may be simple or repetitive, but every commit represents a concept learned and applied.

---

## What’s next

* Add POST request examples
* Build a simple JSON-based API
* Serve a basic ML model using Flask

---

> This repository is part of my journey to strengthen backend and deployment fundamentals alongside machine learning.
